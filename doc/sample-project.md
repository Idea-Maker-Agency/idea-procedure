#Project Spec
##Build a marketplace to sell items.

Create a public github repo to share with me.

- use python3  
- use bootstrap

###There are two user types:
- Owners - Login/signup. Can CRUD items  
- Viewers - anonymous. Can view items.

Viewers can select category and view items and prices.

###Items consist of title, price and category.


## Add api using DRF

- Protect views where appropriate.

- Provide configuration for development and production.
Development would use sqlite3.
Production would use postgres and gunicorn.  
(production doesn't have to run. Just provide sample configuration and directory organization)
