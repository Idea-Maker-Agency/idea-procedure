# Project Spec
## 1. Build a marketplace to sell items.

Create a public github repo to share with me.

- Use python3  
- Use bootstrap
- Protect views where appropriate.

**There are two user types:**
- Owners - Login/signup. Can CRUD items  
- Viewers - anonymous. Can view items.

Viewers can select category and view items and prices.

**Items consist of title, price and category**

## 2. Add api using DRF

## 3. Provide configuration for development and production.
Development would use sqlite3.  
Production would use postgres and gunicorn.  
(production doesn't have to run. Just provide sample configuration and directory organization)
